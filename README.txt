=======NOTE: NO ALT-CHARS ALLOWED IN TOON NAMES Only a-z=============
3) Drag and drop the toonlist onto Read_Toonlist.bat
4) START WOW MANUALLY by clicking on wow.exe (not the blizzard loader!), then close. (You don't have to login. Open and close. You only need to do this once, after drag-n-drop.
5) Double click Hotkeynet.exe
6) Click Load Script button--Load 5mmb_HKN_classic.txt
7) scroll lock on
8) ctrl-alt-m to login
9) When you are in, close all popups. 
10) ctrl-i TWICE to initialize all your wow buttons
11) Hit 0 key twice in your main window to invite/switch to free-for-all loot
(cancel raid warning dialog)
12) Interface Options--turn all action bars on.
13) alt-4 to make everyone follow
14) 2 to attack a single target. F-twice to make all toons attack/talk target.
15) F1-F5 heals main window then next window clockwise
16) alt-3 heals first guy with tank role in toonlist.
17) type /clique and go to your healers/decursers and configure which button
does what when clicking on raid bars. Clicking on those same raid bars in your
main window will make those healers heal/decurse/shield that party member in
exactly the same way!
